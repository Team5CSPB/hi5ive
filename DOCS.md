## Database Schema

The database is designed to store user data, interests, and matches efficiently. Here's an overview of the schema:

- **Users**: Stores user details including username, email, password hash, personal information like first name and last name, optional bio, profile picture, location, and timestamps for record creation and updates.

- **Interests**: Stores interest names that users can associate with their profiles. Each interest has a unique name and timestamps for when it was created and last updated.

- **User_Interests**: Manages the many-to-many relationship between users and their interests. It links user IDs to interest IDs, ensuring that each user can have multiple interests without duplication.

- **Matches**: Stores match data linking two users together, including the status of the match (e.g., 'pending', 'accepted', 'rejected') and the timestamp for when the match was created.

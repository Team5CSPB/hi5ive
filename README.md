## Vision Statement
Have you ever felt isolated and secluded when trying to enjoy your pastime activities? Well, it’s time you reached out and hi 5ive’d someone who perhaps has the same hobbies as you. With Hi5ive, we aim to connect users on a deeper level based on their common interests. 

## Scheduled Weekly Day/Time/TimeZone
Tuesdays at 12pm MST

## Motivation
Before the advent of technology, making friends was done by a matter of convenience. Most of our friends either went to the same school or grew up in the same neighborhood. Times have changed and the more we connect with our devices the harder it is to find actual human interaction. We want to leverage these devices to encourage face to face human interaction starting with the hi5ive application.

## Risk to Completion

- Learning Curve
Some of us have not used Flask, React and other technologies before. This presents a learning curve for the bulk of our team.

- Different Time Zones
This could be an advantage, but also a hindrance as we are spread throughout different places in the world and have a very tight window for meetings. This might present lags in communication.

- Life Events
These could be planned or unplanned. We all have many things going on in our lives as we juggle work with school. We have obligations, family, and other responsibilities to consider which we may need to prioritize over the project.

- No Prior Experience w/Team Members
As we have all just met in this class, we are new to each other’s work ethics, work habits, skill levels, and proficiencies. This factor may play a role in how we execute our tasks.

## Mitigation Strategy
- In order to mitigate the learning curve risk, we have decided to give ourselves enough time to ramp up either through a quick tutorial or an article. Pairing and knowledge sharing is something we will heavily use. Ensuring that we share resources directly with each other is a great practice to navigate the learning curve hurdle.
- Ensuring communication lines are open, we will set up a Google Doc to keep track of our notes as an extension to using discord given that we're all in different timezones. Setting up focused channels for each component of the project, frontend, backend, database, etc. will go in their separate channel to limit endless scrolling. A scheduling channel will also help to ensure communication is transparent.
- Mitigating life events boils to using our communication lines to consistently stay in front of what’s needed for task completion. The team is in agreement to immediately send notice of any conflicts as they arise. If one person misses a meeting, there will be another person who can catch that person up with a quick follow-up zoom call. Meeting notes with highlights will serve to ensure all team members have a snapshot of what was discussed. Asynchronous communication/ tasks will allow everyone to work around the clock and maintain momentum for completing the project.
- Pair programming, honest communication, not expecting each member to know everything and following our chosen development method will ensure we work together as a team.

## Development Method
Scrum will be our method of choice with Trello for our kanban board. We will start with weekly sprints and adjust if we see a need for adjustment.

We did a lot more pair programming this week and spoke highly of the benefits from it. Next week, we will focus on the SQL_Testing.md assignment and continue building on the framework we've implemented. We broke down the tasks by pages where each person will identify functions and tests to make sure these functions work as expected. We will also ensure that we have time in between our schedules to pair up and learn more about different aspects of the project.

This week the team began work on the design of the webpage. We further clarified the objective of and divided responsibilities for the 7/18 page_testing.md project milestone. The team decided to alter our stack, changing our database from MongoDB to sql to align with the course labs and Project Milestone 5.

In the next week the team will finish basic page design and planned testing requirements for each page per milestone 4. Some members of the team will be beginning pair programming, the back end will move to a sql database and continue to implement more of the site pathing. Per milestone 5 the team will begin planning how to implement some test functionality for the database.

On the backend side, the team intialized a basic pytest setup for the flask server, and confirmed the home route and user route runs.
The team completed groundwork on the database side in  mongoDB, with testing connections to be done next week.

We completed a short sprint meeting and review. We also completed a flask server check , this was pushed to the remote origin, and a pull request was intiated. 

Next week the team will be finalizing the wireframes in order to complete project milestone 4, start creating the homepage and signin page in React, incorporate MongoDB into Flask, and implement actual data on the database side.

Minimal changes were needed, it was stated that this week will be busy and our team stressed the importance of communication, as well as keeping things simple and streamlined.
